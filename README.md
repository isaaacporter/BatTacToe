# Bat Tac Toe
This repository holds a tic-tac-toe clone that uses Batman characters. It runs on Crestron processors and is primarily written in SIMPL+. This was an intern project for a few days in the summer of 2018. This is all the files recovered from my old intern computer. I was not very good at keeping versions around, so the final code is in here somewhere, but it is a future Isaac problem to find it and clean it up.
