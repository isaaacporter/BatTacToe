# Bat Tac Toe
This repository holds a tic-tac-toe clone that uses Batman characters. It runs on Crestron processors and is entirely written in SIMPL+. This was an intern project for a few days in the summer of 2018. In 2019, I spent some time to recreate parts of the GUI since it was lost on my old intern laptop. Otherwise, this entire program was written about a week after I first installed SIMPL Windows and SIMPL+.

## Requirements
* Crestron 3-Series or 4-Series Processor
