# Bat Tac Toe
This repository holds a tic-tac-toe clone that uses Batman characters. It runs on Crestron processors and is entirely written in SIMPL+. This was an intern project for a few days in the summer of 2018. In 2019, I spent some time to recreate parts of the GUI since it was lost on my old intern laptop. Otherwise, this entire program was written about a week after I first installed SIMPL Windows and SIMPL+.

# The Game
### Single Player
    Select your preferred character: Batman or Joker. Next, select your difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Difficult, or Impossible. 
* Easy: Randomly selects a spot.
* Medium: Randomly selects some spots, and uses strategy to select others.
* Difficult: Only uses strategy, and there's only 1(?) win scenario.
* Impossible: Only uses strategy. Best outcome is a draw.
### Two Player
    Select your preferred character: Batman or Joker and your friend becomes the other. First selection goes first. This is played on a single touch panel interface.

## Requirements
